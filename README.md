### Hi, I am Harry! ðŸ‘‹

I am systematically studying knowledge related to computer science, especially in the field of open-source software. The repositories contain various simple demos and lab exercises. I hope that one day in the future, I will have the capability to contribute to the open-source community.

[docblog](https://github.com/huanruiz/docblog) is my blog. I've tried various methods to set it up, but in the end, I found that simple text files with github work best for me.
